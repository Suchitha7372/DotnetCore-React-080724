        The early modern period began in the 16th century, when the Mughal Empire conquered most of the Indian
        subcontinent,[16] signaling the proto-industrialisation, becoming the biggest global economy and manufacturing
        power.[17][18][19] The Mughals suffered a gradual decline in the early 18th century, largely due to the rising
        power of the Marathas, who took control of extensive regions of the Indian subcontinent.[20][21] The East India
        Company, acting as a sovereign force on behalf of the British government, gradually acquired control of huge
        areas of India between the middle of the 18th and the middle of the 19th centuries. Policies of company rule in
        India led to the Indian Rebellion of 1857. India was afterwards ruled directly by the British Crown, in the
        British Raj. After World War I, a nationwide struggle for independence was launched by the Indian National
        Congress, led by Mahatma Gandhi. Later, the All-India Muslim League would advocate for a separate
        Muslim-majority nation state. The British Indian Empire was partitioned in August 1947 into the Dominion of
        India and Dominion of Pakistan, each gaining its independence.
